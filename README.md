I used the blog post from [Mike F. Robbins](https://mikefrobbins.com/about/) about how to use symlinks to version-control your PowerShell profile with Git to merge all my PowerShell profiles into one.
It satisfies my requirements and is not too fancy to work on all machines.

Feel free to use it as it is or as inspiration for your own code. 🤟🏼😉
