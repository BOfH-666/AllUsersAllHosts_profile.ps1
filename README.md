# AllUsersAllHosts_profile.ps1

After reading the blog post from [Mike F. Robbins](https://mikefrobbins.com/about/) about how to use symlinks to version-control your PowerShell profile with Git I merged all my PowerShell profiles into one.
It satisfies my requirements and is not too fancy to work on all machines I need.

Feel free to use it as it is or as inspiration for your own code. ü§üüèºüòâ

To create the symlinks for PowerShell and Windows PowerShell start either console elevated, change working directory to where the profile script is and run `CreateSymlink.ps1`.
